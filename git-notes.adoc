= Git & GitFlow Notes

== Introduction
Git provides _many_ choices.  
This is an attempt to reduce git and gitflow to a small enough, usable subset.  The intended audience is people who are familiar with version control in general, possibly just getting started with git, looking to get their head around a workable solution for ~10 teams.

== Use Cases
