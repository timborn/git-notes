= Git & GitFlow Notes

== Introduction
Git provides _many_ choices.  
This is an attempt to reduce git and gitflow to a small enough, usable subset.  The intended audience is people who are familiar with version control in general, possibly just getting started with git, looking to get their head around a workable solution for ~10 teams.

=== Use Cases

== The Zen of Git
Paulo Perrotta on Pluralsight did an outstanding job of explaining what really happens in git.  
I found that key to being able to manage git.  
The key point is the distinct areas: working directory, staging area and your (local) repository.  
The advanced class adds a stash area.  
Every git command operates on these areas; once you understand how they work together things become much more clear.

The best thing you can do to really understand git is to walk through each of the common git commands and understand how it manipulates the working directory, the staging area, the local repo and the remote repo.
Once you do that you will have a much better chance of using git and not doing too much damage.

TIP: if you use git from the command line, it will often give useful and explicit advice
