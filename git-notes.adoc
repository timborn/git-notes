= Git & GitFlow Notes

== Introduction
Git provides _many_ choices.  
This is an attempt to reduce git and gitflow to a small enough, usable subset.  The intended audience is people who are familiar with version control in general, possibly just getting started with git, looking to get their head around a workable solution for ~10 teams.

=== Use Cases

== The Zen of Git
Paulo Perrotta on Pluralsight did an outstanding job of explaining what really happens in git.  
I found that key to being able to manage git.  
The key point is the distinct areas: working directory, staging area and your (local) repository.  
The advanced class adds a stash area.  
Every git command operates on these areas; once you understand how they work together things become much more clear.
